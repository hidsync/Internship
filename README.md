# Internship
Implemented Android application with UI for Singup page. The fields have data validation with the following details:
1. Name (should be at least 4 characters)
2. Address (should be at least 10 characters)
3. Email (should be a valid email address)
4. Phone number (should be at least 10 number + country code)
5. Password (must contain one upper character, one lower character and a number. Max length 15 and min length 8)
I have used Retrofit and GSON to implement the database backend side and viewed through phpMyAdmin. Implemented on localserver.
